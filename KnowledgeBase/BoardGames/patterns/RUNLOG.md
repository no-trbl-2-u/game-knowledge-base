# patterns — run log

One line per weekly `/synthesize-patterns` pass, appended by the pass
itself (see `.claude/commands/synthesize-patterns.md` §Procedure 5).
No-ops log too — a missing line means the job never engaged; a "no-op"
line in a week where `games/` changed is a bug.

Format:
`- <YYYY-MM-DD>: <changed-game-slugs or "no game dirs changed">; <N> pattern doc(s) created, <M> updated, <K> wishlist append(s)`

- 2026-07-05: (retroactive note, written 2026-07-09 during harness setup)
  the first scheduled pass ran 18 turns and committed nothing despite
  game-dir changes that week (quacks scout landed 06:07 that morning) —
  likely the unscoped `git log --stat` was drowned by the 1,692-file
  Dawncaster import. The procedure now scopes the log to
  `KnowledgeBase/BoardGames/games` and requires this RUNLOG line every
  pass. No pattern docs exist yet; next pass should treat the whole
  corpus as changed.
